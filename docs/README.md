# API documentation for CAI Node.js library

The files in these directories are generated by TypeDoc (except for `index.md`). The files are generated into these directories in the workflow ONLY; they are not checked in:

- `classes`
- `functions`
- `interfaces`
- `type-aliases`

All the other files under `/docs` (which are checked in) are used to scaffold the Jekyll site.

The `publish-docs.yml` workflow runs TypeDoc, runs Jekyll, and publishes the resulting HTML using GitHub Pages.
